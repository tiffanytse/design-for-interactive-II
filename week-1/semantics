<h1> Planets </h1>
 
<p>A planet is a celestial body, orbiting a star, that is massive 
enough to be gravitationally rounded and has “cleared the 
neighbourhood” around its orbit. </p>

Unfortunately, Pluto is no longer a planet but a dwarf 
planet. Sometimes I think, Pluto still deserves full planet hood.
